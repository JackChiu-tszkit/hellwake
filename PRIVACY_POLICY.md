## Introduction

HellWake ("we", "our", or "app") respects your privacy. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information.

## Information Collection

HellWake is a locally-running alarm clock app. **We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data**.

The app locally stores the following information on your device:
- Alarm settings (target shake count, challenge mode toggle)
- Onboarding state (whether first-time setup is completed)

This information is stored only on your device and is not uploaded to any server.

### Permission Usage Explanation

To provide core functionality, the app requires the following permissions:

1. **Notification Permission**
   - **Purpose**: To remind you to wake up at the set time
   - **Data Collection**: None

2. **Motion Sensor Permission**
   - **Purpose**: To detect the number of times you shake your device, used for turning off the alarm
   - **Data Collection**: None (all detection is done locally on device, not recorded or transmitted)

3. **Audio Playback Permission**
   - **Purpose**: To play alarm sounds
   - **Data Collection**: None

## Data Storage

All data is stored only locally on your device using the following technologies:

- The app does not contain any analytics or tracking code

## Third-Party Services

The app does not integrate any third-party services, analytics tools, or advertising networks.

## Children's Privacy

## Your Rights

Since we do not collect personal data, you do not need to worry about data deletion or access requests. You can delete all locally stored data at any time by uninstalling the app.

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device, data security depends on your device security settings. We recommend:
- Using device password or biometric lock
- Regularly updating operating system
- Not jailbreaking or rooting your device

## Privacy Policy Changes

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Significant changes will be notified through app updates.
